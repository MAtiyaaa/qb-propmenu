# In-game Prop Offset Editor (BETA VERSION)
* Made by Atiya
* Discord: atiya.
* Github: https://github.com/MAtiyaaa

# Description
* **Spawn a prop in-game and edit the offset for a certain prop within the menu.**
* **Copy to clipboard by closing the menu.**
* **Script is still WIP, meaning bugs will be present.**
* **Making this was relatively frustrating, some of the code available is probably useless and/or overdoing it**

# Known Issues
* **Rotation input isn't working. Trying to find a fix for this lol.**
* **Bone ID's are all being recognized as the same. That's why I'm only recommending to download the script for the offset factor, and nothing else.**

# Future Versions
* **Working bone and rotation input.**
* **Live updates (not having to spawn another prop when changing offset)**
